    "\n",
    "Attempting to find some co-occurence patterns in the flow data according to how an algorithm like word2vec, in its skip-gram implementation specifically for this work, works. The idea is that flows, $V_{f}$ for vector representation, that occur within a window $W_{f}$, which can be modeled as \"time\" using timestamps from the capture or just raw capture data. For brevity we will be testing raw capture for now and will transition to \"time\" in the future. I'll transition to writing a time based function futher down in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Note here that using time-stamp windowing will allow for variable sentence length\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the conditional probabilities $P(w|f)$, with a given set of flow captures _Captures_, the goal is to set the parameters $\\theta$ of $P(w|f;\\theta)$ so as to maximize the capture probability :\n",
    "\n",

    "The word2vec algorithm seems to capture an underlying phenomenon of written language that clusters words together according to their linguistic similarity, this can be seen in something like simple synonym analysis. The goal is to exploit this underlying \"similarity\" phenomenon in the \"conversations\" that machines are having within a given data network. This can also be thought of as written text being an express conversation between the writer and the reader. This is the idea behind using word2vec on flow capture data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each \"time step\", right now just being a subset of a given flow data set, is as a 'sentence' in the word2vec model. We should then be able to find flow \"similarities\" that exist within the context of flows. The idea is this \"symilarity\" will really just yield an occurence pattern over the flow data, much like word2vec does for written text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another part of the idea is much like in written text there are word / context, $(w,c)$, patterns that are discovered and exploited when running the algorithm over a given set of written language. There are common occurences and patterns that can be yielded from flow data, much like the occurences and patterns that are mined from written text. At the end of the embedding exercise we can use k-means to attempt to cluster unseen flows. This should yield some sort of clustering of commonly occuring flows that have the same occurence measure in a given set of netflow captures. We can then use this data to measure against other, unseen, flows for future classification of \"anamoly\". I use that word loosely as this is strictly expirimental.\n",
